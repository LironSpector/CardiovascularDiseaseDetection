        <p>My name is Liron Spector. I am 16 years old and  I am a student in "Blich" high school.</p>
        <p>I have built this website to help people find out if they have a cardiovascular disease or not. I'm not asking you to give me any permissions, you can register for free and check.</p>
        <p>In addition to helping you find out if you have a cardiovascular disease, I also have general information and details about how you can improve your health.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is to give some details about your current health and I will try to tell you if you have a cardiovascular disease. I donâ€™t promise to give you an accurate answer, but I will give you another opinion that might help you find out if you have a cardiovascular disease.</p>
